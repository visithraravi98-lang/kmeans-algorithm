# kmeans-algorithm
This project implements the K-Means clustering algorithm from scratch using Numpy to understand its core working principles.A synthetic dataset with three clusters is used to evaluate the custom implementation, and its performance is compared with the scikit-learn K-Means algorithm using inertia and silhouette score.
